# Torch.ai-Programming-Exercise-Code
Contains the code for my submission for the programming exercise for Torch.ai.

Note that I used this video and its accompanying github for help doing this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJxpyO3ei4.

To run my code, you will need to download Ollama, and then download llama3.1 (found here https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) and 
the nomic embedding model (found here https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text:latest) for it. Download the packages in requirements.txt, and after that, run main.py to run the applet. Sample queries and responses for them can be found in test_cases.pdf. Note that when the applet asks for certain responses (such as "Yes" or "No"), it is case sensitive. For your first run of the applet you will want to update the database or the LLM will have no text to work with, only general knowledge.
