# Torch.ai-Programming-Exercise-Code
Contains the code for my submission for the programming exercise for Torch.ai.

Note that I used this video and its accompanying github for help doing this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJxpyO3ei4.

To run my code, you will need to download Ollama, and then download llama3.1 (found here https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) and 
the nomic embedding model (found here https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text:latest) for it. Download the packages in requirements.txt, and after that, run main.py to run the applet.
